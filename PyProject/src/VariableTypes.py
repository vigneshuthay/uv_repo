#Python's dictionaries are kind of hash-table type. 
#They work like associative arrays or hashes found in Perl and consist of key-value pairs. 
#A dictionary key can be almost any Python type, but are usually numbers or strings. Values, 
#on the other hand, can be any arbitrary Python object.

#Dictionaries are enclosed by curly braces ({ }) and values can be assigned and accessed using square braces ([]).
